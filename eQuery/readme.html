Enhanced Query Widget

By: Kevin MacLeod - Savannah - Chatham Area GIS 

Version: Alpha 2 development build  10/8/15


Setup: 
Define the service and initial layer to query in WebApp Builder in the widget setup when you add the widget. 

Use:
This widget allows you to build queries for any field, in any layer, for any service. 

You use the buttons to create SQL queries that will be created as a URL and submitted to the map service you define with the REST link you provide in the widget setup. This widget essentially replicates the functionality and feel of ArcMap's 'Select By Attributes' tool.

You can manually enter SQL syntax or use the buttons to construct a query.  I recommend using the buttons so the spacing and syntax are correct.

To Do:

1. wire results to the attribute table widget (add as results layer to attribute table like Robert's eSearch)

2. add option to restrict results by geometry. By map extent for version 1.0 and in future versions, potentially by user-drawn geometry i.e. circle, square, lasso.

3. Better error handling and dealing with no results.

4. Refine UI. Better html, text boxes, buttons, dialogues, etc. 
Add progress bar while it searches for results. 

5. Test and debug.
